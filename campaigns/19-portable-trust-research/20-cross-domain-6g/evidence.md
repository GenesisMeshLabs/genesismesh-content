# Evidence ledger: idea 20

Review date: 2026-11-04. Author: Codex draft researcher. Independent source review is recorded separately against final hashes. This is a source-review packet, not a product certification or a passing test report.

## Research scope

[Beyond Certificates: 6G-ready Access Control for the Service-Based Architecture with Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19366) — 2024-02-23 arXiv v3; EuCNC/6G Summit 2024.

The original abstract specifies a 5G Service-Based Architecture prototype. The article makes no claim of deployed 6G, standard conformance, performance or production telecom integration.

## Revisions and availability

Core: `a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063`. TypeScript: `8154ca7ac459ffbcd22d35900ca72f8093165bfc`. Both are in the coordinated 1.9.1 source train. The [release snapshot](../source-release-snapshot.json) records actual GitHub release tags and assets.

The [independent registry review](../source-review.md) verifies PyPI genesis-mesh 1.9.1 (2026-11-04 08:59 UTC), npm genesis-mesh-sdk 1.9.1 (08:59 UTC), and NuGet genesismesh-sdk-dotnet 1.9.1 (09:46 UTC). No packages were installed or scenario tests run in this review.

The public website and trust demo were viewed without authentication on 2026-11-04. The demo reported runtime 1.9.0 while the release train is 1.9.1; articles assert interface availability only. The website's 1.8.1 label is stale. No Patreon publication date has been assigned to this new article.

## Material claims

### 20-1

Exact article wording: A then checks B's attestation through that treaty.

Affected sections/assets: Direct scoped recognition; article.md, identical patreon.md and corresponding bounded LinkedIn wording.

- Implementation: [inspected symbol or model](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/trust/treaty.py#L145).
- Tests: [inspected test source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/tests/test_recognition_treaties.py). **Not executed** in this review.
- Scope, limitations and decision: Implemented and test-covered. The integration supplies trusted issuer keys and local revocation state; the treaty scopes accepted roles, statuses and validity.
- Availability: underlying source is in the pinned 1.9.1 release train. Telecom, EV and payment adaptations remain illustrative, not implemented by this work. No complete SDK parity or live feature availability is asserted.

### 20-2

Exact article wording: The signature on the treaty belongs to the accepting domain.

Affected sections/assets: Authority ownership; article.md, identical patreon.md and corresponding bounded LinkedIn wording.

- Implementation: [inspected symbol or model](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/trust/treaty.py#L95).
- Tests: [inspected test source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/tests/test_recognition_treaties.py). **Not executed** in this review.
- Scope, limitations and decision: Direct recognition by the accepting sovereign. Telecom identities and adapters are illustrative, with no automatic permission implied by recognition.
- Availability: underlying source is in the pinned 1.9.1 release train. Telecom, EV and payment adaptations remain illustrative, not implemented by this work. No complete SDK parity or live feature availability is asserted.

### 20-3

Exact article wording: The recognition demo accepts an attestation, revokes the treaty in the accepting domain, then rejects the same attestation with `treaty_locally_revoked`.

Affected sections/assets: Revocation failure path; article.md, identical patreon.md and corresponding bounded LinkedIn wording.

- Implementation: [inspected symbol or model](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/docs/examples/assets/scripts/recognition-treaty-demo.py).
- Tests: [inspected test source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/tests/test_recognition_treaties.py). **Not executed** in this review.
- Scope, limitations and decision: Documented and source-inspected. The refusal occurs at the accepting verifier with updated local state; disconnected revocation is not instantaneous.
- Availability: underlying source is in the pinned 1.9.1 release train. Telecom, EV and payment adaptations remain illustrative, not implemented by this work. No complete SDK parity or live feature availability is asserted.

### 20-4

Exact article wording: These are two demonstrated building blocks, not a claim that presenting any foreign attestation automatically feeds the local evaluation route.

Affected sections/assets: Recognition vs execution; article.md, identical patreon.md and corresponding bounded LinkedIn wording.

- Implementation: [inspected symbol or model](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/models/context.py#L148).
- Tests: [inspected test source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/tests/test_attestation_boundary.py#L128). **Not executed** in this review.
- Scope, limitations and decision: Article requires local authorization mapping and actual service enforcement. No automatic foreign-attestation-to-local-evaluation bridge or telecom integration is claimed.
- Availability: underlying source is in the pinned 1.9.1 release train. Telecom, EV and payment adaptations remain illustrative, not implemented by this work. No complete SDK parity or live feature availability is asserted.

No guessed section anchors are used.

Known drift: the current SDK overview documents .NET governed-client support from 1.9.0, while some older concept/example/public-contract narrative still says it only verifies. The article avoids that stale statement. The selective-disclosure introduction overstates identifier privacy; idea 24 follows the actual record models. Logic-attestation wording is limited to declared configuration, with no measured-runtime claim.

| Gateway | 2e6486ee6a6481adca1be3b9dae70a4ef32036f9; GitHub 1.9.1 binaries | Neither policy authority nor application executor. No routing/proxy behavior asserted in these articles. |
| Edge binary | Rust repository 1.9.1 assets; beta | Relevant deployment possibility for idea 23 only. No specific automatic fallback or payment-wallet behavior claimed. |
| Public demo | Browser-observed runtime 1.9.0 | Available trust UI only. No agent-configuration, telecom, EV, payment or privacy scenario execution claimed. |

SDK matrix: [canonical overview](https://docs.genesismesh.org/sdk/index.html), with [pinned source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/docs/sdk/index.md). Contract: [pinned public contract](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/docs/reference/public-contract.md). Beta/stability classification is distinct from dated narrative about SDK coverage.

## Observed verification and reader procedure

Read-only GitHub source fetches and primary paper/documentation reads were performed. Fields, functions and test assertions were inspected. No product runtime, payment operation or publication was mutated by this author. All application scenes are explicitly illustrative.

The reader procedure uses documented commands, prerequisites, expected acceptance and refusal cases, and an explicit statement that it was not executed in this review. The article contains no financial or legal recommendation or regulatory-compliance claim.

Reader URL inventory: links.json. Final hashes and release gates: review.md and hashes.json. Recheck release/deployment evidence before any later material revision or publication claim.
