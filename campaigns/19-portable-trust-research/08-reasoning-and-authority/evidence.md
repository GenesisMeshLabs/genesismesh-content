# Evidence ledger - idea 3: The agent can reason. Should it grant itself authority?

Review date: 2026-11-04. Intended publication date: not assigned. Authoring reviewer: Codex campaign author.
Core source inspected at a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063. Latest core release v1.9.1 confirmed from the GitHub release API. Release availability and source-head content are distinct; no hosted deployment or cross-language parity is inferred.
Observed work: public primary-source web reads; GitHub code/test/contract inspection; local editorial review. No Genesis Mesh test, demo, deployment, payment or side effect was executed. Test-covered means assertions read, not passing test execution.

## Source and release inventory

| Surface | Pinned revision | Availability / relevance |
|---|---|---|
| genesismesh | a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063 | GitHub release [v1.9.1](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/releases/tag/v1.9.1); Python Network Authority / CLI and source demo are the bounded implementation in this article. CLI delegation, invocation tokens and guard are beta per contract; policy HTTP operations and audit commands have their own contract classifications. |
| sdk-typescript | 8154ca7ac459ffbcd22d35900ca72f8093165bfc | GitHub release [v1.9.1](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/sdk-typescript/releases/tag/v1.9.1); Maintained separate TypeScript SDK; not used by these Python examples. No transport adapter, global budget or replay guarantee inferred. |
| sdk-go | ade949888eacd0ccc16126941427e1211f82aec8 | GitHub release [v1.9.1](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/sdk-go/releases/tag/v1.9.1); Maintained separate SDK. No delegation, guard, policy-wrapper or audit-pack parity claim made; not used by reproduction procedure. |
| sdk-rust | b67c248717d5d99aca6f4dad320692f3f6c07c69 | GitHub release [v1.9.1](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/sdk-rust/releases/tag/v1.9.1); Separate implementation; release has verifier and edge binaries. Article 5 discusses the documented verifier, not all SDK parity. Other articles make no Rust integration claims. |
| sdk-dotnet | 241d99b7508b378ce7c613dfc0baeed7cc5df56c | GitHub release [v1.9.1](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/sdk-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.9.1); Maintained separate SDK; governed client shipped in 1.9.0 (independent release review). No parity assumed from stale core docs; not used by this example. |
| gateway | 2e6486ee6a6481adca1be3b9dae70a4ef32036f9 | GitHub release [v1.9.1](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/gateway/releases/tag/v1.9.1); Separate beta gateway; not the authority or enforcement mechanism used by these examples. Not relevant to the local Python flow; no proxy or fallback behavior claimed. |
| Python core API | Same core revision | Delegation/token/guard symbols scoped to inspected implementation; CLI beta is stated publicly where relevant. |
| Edge agent | sdk-rust revision above | Not relevant: these articles do not claim disconnected grant execution or edge fallback. |
| PHP | Public-surface contract identifies unsupported old SDK | Not on release train; no PHP claim. |
| Public demo | Browser-read UI, runtime displayed 1.9.0 | Public browser observation verified access; no scenario run. Does not prove latest source deployed. |

The current public-surface contract is pinned at https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/contract/public-surface.json . Some old coverage prose lags current .NET releases, so it is not used to assert absence of new .NET functionality.

## Material claims

### Claim 3-1
- Exact wording / scope: The controller receives a signed BoundaryDecision with a policy binding for its context.
- Affected assets: article.md, identical patreon.md and the narrower linkedin.md.
- Implementation: https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/na_service/services/boundary_policy.py#L387-L405
- Test: https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/tests/test_na_boundary_policy.py
- Documentation / reader check: https://docs.genesismesh.org/examples/declarative-boundary-policy.html
- Observed verification and limits: Implemented; NA service inspected. Demo is documented, not executed.
- Reviewer decision: qualify as written; never upgrade inspected/test-covered to tested.

### Claim 3-2
- Exact wording / scope: A failed enforce gate denies; an observe gate records without denying.
- Affected assets: article.md, identical patreon.md and the narrower linkedin.md.
- Implementation: https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/trust/context/policy.py#L439-L511
- Test: https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/tests/test_na_boundary_policy.py
- Documentation / reader check: https://docs.genesismesh.org/examples/declarative-boundary-policy.html
- Observed verification and limits: Implemented and test-covered. Does not authenticate truth of caller-supplied facts.
- Reviewer decision: qualify as written; never upgrade inspected/test-covered to tested.

### Claim 3-3
- Exact wording / scope: The demo denies amount2500 under cap1000 and refuses legacy route in required mode.
- Affected assets: article.md, identical patreon.md and the narrower linkedin.md.
- Implementation: https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/docs/examples/assets/scripts/boundary-policy-demo.py#L50-L126

- Documentation / reader check: https://docs.genesismesh.org/examples/declarative-boundary-policy.html
- Observed verification and limits: Source and documented outcome inspected, no run here.
- Reviewer decision: qualify as written; never upgrade inspected/test-covered to tested.

Only relevant ones are linked in the article.
- Website https://genesismesh.org/ and public demo https://mesh.genesismesh.org/ were verified through the public browser UI; web-fetch root failure was a tool limitation, not evidence of site downtime.
- GitHub repository is public and connected fetch succeeded. No temporary URLs or private credentials are in the copy.

## Reproduction scope
The article links the actual documented local procedure with prerequisites, expected result and failure. Its command was inspected in the documented example; it was not run here. Example source dates and expiry must be current when readers create their own records. Prefer the source demo's controlled fixture clock, where supplied, to blindly reusing historical timestamps; the delegation demo uses a fixed scenario time.
Sources show a mechanism and tests show asserted cases. Production adoption still needs integration-specific execution binding, key management, trusted facts and appropriate confinement. No research performance or security percentage is transferred to Genesis Mesh.
