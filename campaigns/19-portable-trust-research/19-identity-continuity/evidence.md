# Evidence ledger: idea 19

Review date: 2026-11-04. Author: Codex draft researcher. Independent source review is recorded separately against final hashes. This is a source-review packet, not a product certification or a passing test report.

## Research scope

[AgentDID: Trustless Identity Authentication for AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.25189) — 2026-04-28, arXiv v1.

The original paper's abstract and metadata were inspected. The authors describe challenge-response state verification. The article does not claim replication, performance parity, AgentDID interoperability or independent measurement by Genesis Mesh.

## Revisions and availability

Core: `a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063`. TypeScript: `8154ca7ac459ffbcd22d35900ca72f8093165bfc`. Both are in the coordinated 1.9.1 source train. The [release snapshot](../source-release-snapshot.json) records actual GitHub release tags and assets.

The [independent registry review](../source-review.md) verifies PyPI genesis-mesh 1.9.1 (2026-11-04 08:59 UTC), npm genesis-mesh-sdk 1.9.1 (08:59 UTC), and NuGet genesismesh-sdk-dotnet 1.9.1 (09:46 UTC). No packages were installed or scenario tests run in this review.

The public website and trust demo were viewed without authentication on 2026-11-04. The demo reported runtime 1.9.0 while the release train is 1.9.1; articles assert interface availability only. The website's 1.8.1 label is stale. No Patreon publication date has been assigned to this new article.

## Material claims

Concise revision: each quotation below appears in the revised article. The same claims apply to the identical Patreon copy; LinkedIn uses a narrower summary. Existing dated source and release checks remain the baseline. No product examples or tests were executed.

### 19-1

Exact article wording: An operator supplies trusted agent keys and an `AttestationPolicy`; `verify_model_attestation` checks signature, expiry and configured model, prompt-hash and tool-hash allowlists.

- Implementation: [inspected source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/trust/logic_attestation.py#L86).
- Tests: [inspected test source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/tests/test_verifiable_logic_attestation.py#L187); not executed.
- Scope, limits and authority boundary: Beta reference functions. A signed ModelAttestation describes declared configuration, not independent runtime measurement. Its fields are defined in genesis_mesh/models/attestation.py at line 47. Empty allowlists are unrestricted; model version is recorded but not allowlisted; require_bound_token checks presence only.
- Evidence level: source-inspected implementation and test assertions; no runtime result is claimed. The relevant release and surface matrix below controls availability, not the illustrative application.

### 19-2

Exact article wording: A `LogicAttestationGate` integrates that check into a local boundary evaluation.

- Implementation: [inspected source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/trust/logic_attestation.py#L143).
- Tests: [inspected test source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/tests/test_verifiable_logic_attestation.py#L370); not executed.
- Scope, limits and authority boundary: Opt-in local Python gate; no automatic gateway enforcement or universal SDK parity. Source-inspected prompt/tool mismatches refuse the declared configuration.
- Evidence level: source-inspected implementation and test assertions; no runtime result is claimed. The relevant release and surface matrix below controls availability, not the illustrative application.

### 19-3

Exact article wording: The relying application authenticates the caller, binds the decision to the requested action and controls execution.

- Implementation: [inspected source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/models/context.py#L44).
- Tests: [inspected test source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/tests/test_attestation_boundary.py#L233); not executed.
- Scope, limits and authority boundary: Consuming-integration responsibility, not a claim that signature verification authenticates the caller or measures the process. The attestation-backed example separates local policy evaluation from caller authentication.
- Evidence level: source-inspected implementation and test assertions; no runtime result is claimed. The relevant release and surface matrix below controls availability, not the illustrative application.

No guessed section anchors are used.

Known drift: the current SDK overview documents .NET governed-client support from 1.9.0, while some older concept/example/public-contract narrative still says it only verifies. The article avoids that stale statement. The selective-disclosure introduction overstates identifier privacy; idea 24 follows the actual record models. Logic-attestation wording is limited to declared configuration, with no measured-runtime claim.

SDK matrix: [canonical overview](https://docs.genesismesh.org/sdk/index.html), with [pinned source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/docs/sdk/index.md). Contract: [pinned public contract](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/docs/reference/public-contract.md). Beta/stability classification is distinct from dated narrative about SDK coverage.

## Observed verification and reader procedure

Read-only GitHub source fetches and primary paper/documentation reads were performed. Fields, functions and test assertions were inspected. No product runtime, payment operation or publication was mutated by this author. All application scenes are explicitly illustrative.

The reader procedure uses documented commands, prerequisites, expected acceptance and refusal cases, and an explicit statement that it was not executed in this review. The article contains no financial or legal recommendation or regulatory-compliance claim.

Reader URL inventory: campaign.json source_docs and the article citations. Final asset hashes and release gates are recorded in review.md. Recheck release/deployment evidence before any later material revision or publication claim.


## Final beta qualification

Logic-attestation functions are explicitly qualified as beta in the article and Patreon copy. The canonical [public contract](https://docs.genesismesh.org/reference/public-contract.html) was opened and checked on 2026-11-04. This classification does not establish production deployment or complete SDK parity.

## Concise revision record

The article was shortened at the user's request on 2026-11-04. Secondary mechanisms and repeated caveats were removed; the retained claim quotations above supersede the earlier wording. Same-session primary-source, pinned implementation, canonical-documentation and release checks remain applicable. No new capability or deployment claim was added. The condensed revision awaits independent review against its updated hashes.
