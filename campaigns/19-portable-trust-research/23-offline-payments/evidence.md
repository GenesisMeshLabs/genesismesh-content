# Evidence ledger: idea 23

Review date: 2026-11-04. Author: Codex draft researcher. Independent source review is recorded separately against final hashes. This is a source-review packet, not a product certification or a passing test report.

## Research scope

[PayOff: A Regulated Central Bank Digital Currency with Private Offline Payments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06956) — 2024-08-13 arXiv v1.

The original abstract was inspected for the design and stated limitations. No performance figures, replication or reuse of the payment protocol is claimed.

## Revisions and availability

Core: `a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063`. TypeScript: `8154ca7ac459ffbcd22d35900ca72f8093165bfc`. Both are in the coordinated 1.9.1 source train. The [release snapshot](../source-release-snapshot.json) records actual GitHub release tags and assets.

The [independent registry review](../source-review.md) verifies PyPI genesis-mesh 1.9.1 (2026-11-04 08:59 UTC), npm genesis-mesh-sdk 1.9.1 (08:59 UTC), and NuGet genesismesh-sdk-dotnet 1.9.1 (09:46 UTC). No packages were installed or scenario tests run in this review.

The public website and trust demo were viewed without authentication on 2026-11-04. The demo reported runtime 1.9.0 while the release train is 1.9.1; articles assert interface availability only. The website's 1.8.1 label is stale. No Patreon publication date has been assigned to this new article.

## Material claims

Concise revision: each quotation below appears in the revised article. The same claims apply to the identical Patreon copy; LinkedIn uses a narrower summary. Existing dated source and release checks remain the baseline. No product examples or tests were executed.

### 23-1

Exact article wording: It specifies a registered bearer key, capabilities, validity interval, use budget and closed parameter envelope.

- Implementation: [inspected source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/models/grants.py#L266).
- Tests: [inspected test source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/tests/test_grants.py#L242); not executed.
- Scope, limits and authority boundary: Beta grant routes and signed CapabilityGrant fields. TimeToken ties bounded use progression to a known chain position. Charging and payment adaptations are illustrative; a use count is not a balance or shared monetary budget.
- Evidence level: source-inspected implementation and test assertions; no runtime result is claimed. The relevant release and surface matrix below controls availability, not the illustrative application.

### 23-2

Exact article wording: A holder records signed `GrantExecutionEvidence`, including sequence, previous-use digest, request parameters and reported outcome.

- Implementation: [inspected source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/models/grants.py#L383).
- Tests: [inspected test source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/tests/test_grants.py#L336); not executed.
- Scope, limits and authority boundary: Signed evidence records reported execution, not independently measured physical or financial effects. Uses carry time-token and grant bindings; no instant settlement follows.
- Evidence level: source-inspected implementation and test assertions; no runtime result is claimed. The relevant release and surface matrix below controls availability, not the illustrative application.

### 23-3

Exact article wording: On reconnection, the authority checks submitted uses against scope, budget, time-token and revocation rules before admitting evidence.

- Implementation: [inspected source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/trust/grants.py#L766).
- Tests: [inspected test source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/tests/test_grants.py#L382); not executed.
- Scope, limits and authority boundary: Admission uses required supplied state and chain context; invalid records may be quarantined. No automatic fallback claim or universal client parity. A refusal cannot undo an action already performed.
- Evidence level: source-inspected implementation and test assertions; no runtime result is claimed. The relevant release and surface matrix below controls availability, not the illustrative application.

### 23-4

Exact article wording: Disconnection also prevents immediate knowledge of a new revocation.

- Implementation: [inspected source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/trust/grants.py#L766).
- Tests: [inspected test source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/genesis_mesh/tests/test_grants.py#L543); not executed.
- Scope, limits and authority boundary: Offline information limit documented in the grant operating guide. Expiry, budgets and time-token limits do not establish tamper-proof state, payment conservation, replay safety, double-spending prevention or settlement.
- Evidence level: source-inspected implementation and test assertions; no runtime result is claimed. The relevant release and surface matrix below controls availability, not the illustrative application.

Known drift: the current SDK overview documents .NET governed-client support from 1.9.0, while some older concept/example/public-contract narrative still says it only verifies. The article avoids that stale statement. The selective-disclosure introduction overstates identifier privacy; idea 24 follows the actual record models. Logic-attestation wording is limited to declared configuration, with no measured-runtime claim.

## Relevant surface inventory

| .NET | 241d99b7508b378ce7c613dfc0baeed7cc5df56c; NuGet 1.9.1 | Current overview documents governed-client support from 1.9.0. Broader code paths are not asserted or tested here. |
| Go | ade949888eacd0ccc16126941427e1211f82aec8; GitHub 1.9.1 | Verifier plus thin client in current overview. No native governed callback or grant-holder parity assumed. |
| PHP source | c346d1ece0111b210006049d772fb39c3833e370; source 0.56.0 | Independent review found no GitHub release/tag or Packagist package. No PHP availability claim; not used in these flows. |
| Gateway | 2e6486ee6a6481adca1be3b9dae70a4ef32036f9; GitHub 1.9.1 binaries | Neither policy authority nor application executor. No routing/proxy behavior asserted in these articles. |
| Edge binary | Rust repository 1.9.1 assets; beta | Relevant deployment possibility for idea 23 only. No specific automatic fallback or payment-wallet behavior claimed. |
| Public demo | Browser-observed runtime 1.9.0 | Available trust UI only. No agent-configuration, telecom, EV, payment or privacy scenario execution claimed. |

SDK matrix: [canonical overview](https://docs.genesismesh.org/sdk/index.html), with [pinned source](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/docs/sdk/index.md). Contract: [pinned public contract](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/genesismesh/blob/a54b2d81f205c9b0203158f846f7ad44dc677063/docs/reference/public-contract.md). Beta/stability classification is distinct from dated narrative about SDK coverage.

## Observed verification and reader procedure

Read-only GitHub source fetches and primary paper/documentation reads were performed. Fields, functions and test assertions were inspected. No product runtime, payment operation or publication was mutated by this author. All application scenes are explicitly illustrative.

The reader procedure uses documented commands, prerequisites, expected acceptance and refusal cases, and an explicit statement that it was not executed in this review. The article contains no financial or legal recommendation or regulatory-compliance claim.

Reader URL inventory: campaign.json source_docs and the article citations. Final asset hashes and release gates are recorded in review.md. Recheck release/deployment evidence before any later material revision or publication claim.


## Final beta qualification

Grant routes are explicitly qualified as beta in the article and Patreon copy. The canonical [public contract](https://docs.genesismesh.org/reference/public-contract.html) was opened and checked on 2026-11-04. This classification does not establish production deployment or complete SDK parity.

## Concise revision record

The article was shortened at the user's request on 2026-11-04. Secondary mechanisms and repeated caveats were removed; the retained claim quotations above supersede the earlier wording. Same-session primary-source, pinned implementation, canonical-documentation and release checks remain applicable. No new capability or deployment claim was added. The condensed revision awaits independent review against its updated hashes.
