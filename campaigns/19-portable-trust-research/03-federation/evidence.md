# Evidence review: Federation without surrendering local control

Reviewed: 2026-11-04. Original campaign idea: 12. Evidence level: current documentation and source inspection, compared with the article’s pinned implementation snapshots. No product tests, examples, live actions or hardware exercises were run for this review.

## Recognition and local permission

A treaty scopes accepted foreign claims. It does not supply the receiving application’s permission for every action or override a foreign membership revocation.

## Freshness and withdrawal

Treaty verification checks issuer/subject, status, validity, signatures and local revocation. Feed sequencing depends on the caller supplying retained minimum sequence state; a signature alone does not prevent replay of old information.

## Deployment evidence

The two-cloud proof is a documented maintainer-operated historical demonstration. It is not proof of a current live run or independently owned external operators.

## Research scope

Federating Trust Perimeters proposes SPIRE-related extensions, including remote attestation, token exchange and ledger governance. The article explicitly declines to claim Genesis Mesh implements that architecture.

## Release scope and limitations

Current source and release check: 2026-11-04. The core, TypeScript, Go, Rust, .NET and gateway repositories each have a non-draft, non-prerelease GitHub v1.9.1 release. This establishes published source/release artifacts, not the version running at a particular deployment. The current [SDK capability matrix](https://docs.genesismesh.org/sdk/index.html) places TypeScript, Rust and .NET in the governed-client tier; Go remains a verifier plus thin client. Shared version numbers do not imply identical features. No Python standalone-client, PHP parity or universal SDK coverage is inferred.

Some older scope paragraphs in the [grant runbook](https://docs.genesismesh.org/operations/grants.html) and [governed-changes concept](https://docs.genesismesh.org/concepts/governed-changes.html) still describe .NET as lacking governed-client features. For current availability, use the SDK matrix and [.NET 1.9.0 release](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/sdk-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.9.0). Those paragraphs do not override the newer implementation and release evidence.

The [Rust 1.9.1 security advisory](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/sdk-rust/security/advisories/GHSA-cwf5-mqxw-75hq) fixes direct verification of certain records with missing own timestamps under NA key history. The edge agent and standalone `genesis-mesh-verify` are explicitly unaffected. The analogous [TypeScript fix](https://github.com/GenesisMeshLabs/sdk-typescript/security/advisories/GHSA-rx24-98gh-f8mc) shipped in 1.9.0. Historical pinned source links are evidence snapshots, not installation recommendations.

No material correction identified. Relevant treaty implementation and proof documentation are unchanged at current core. The proposed withdrawal tests remain proposals, not reported results.
